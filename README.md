# Real-Time-Analog-Clock-using-MATLAB

This project implements a real-time analog clock using MATLAB, showcasing the current time with an interactive graphical interface. The clock features hour, minute, and second hands that dynamically update every second, providing an accurate representation of the current time.

Features

Real-Time Updates: Clock hands update every second for real-time accuracy.
Smooth Circular Design: A visually appealing clock face created using polar coordinates.
Dynamic Hand Movement: Hands are calculated using trigonometric functions for realistic motion.
Hour Ticks: Clear markings for each hour enhance readability.
Getting Started


To run the clock, simply execute the analogClock function in MATLAB. Make sure you have MATLAB installed.
